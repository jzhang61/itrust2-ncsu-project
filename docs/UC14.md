# UC14 Alert Users by Email
## 14.1 Preconditions:

An event requiring an email alert has occurred.
## 14.2 Main Flow:

An email alert is sent out to the iTrust user in the event of a changed password or reset [S1], status change in appointment request [S2], or account lockout [S3].  If the user has no email address on file, then an email is not sent [E1].  All events are logged.

## 14.3 Sub-flows:

   * [S1] The user has successfully changed his/her password (UC11, S1/S2). An email informing the user of the password change is sent to the user including the MID but not the password.
   * [S2] The status of an appointment request has been changed by the HCP involved in the request (UC6, S3).  An email informing the patient of their appointment status is sent.
   * [S3] A user account has been locked out, either temporarily or permanently, due to too many failed logins.  An email informing the user of their lockout is sent.

## 14.4 Alternative Flows:

   * [E1] If the user does not have an email address on file, no email is sent and the failure is logged.
